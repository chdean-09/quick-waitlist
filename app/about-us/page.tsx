              It&apos;s been a year since I had the problem and this crazy idea, I&apos;m tired of finding apartments/boarding houses near our school, it&apos;s always unsatisfactory for my taste and it took a long time and energy to find the perfect one. I thought that I was the only one who had this problem. <br />


              Turns out I&apos;m not alone, I&apos;ve read a lot of FB group posts and observed that when finding your preferred living space requires a lot of time like months of walking, searching, and waiting for someone to post in the FB groups that one room na maganda and It&apos;s frustrating when the next morning taken na sya agad. Some people want to know the location if it is near your work or school, a unit with aircon, and nice ambience. <br />


              So I asked myself, what if gumawa ako ng website? After a year of struggling on core features, identifying the problem, and defining use cases. I found out users need security, convenience, and preference.
