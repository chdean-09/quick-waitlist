            It&apos;s been a year since we had the problem and this crazy idea. We are tired of finding apartments/boarding houses near our school. It&apos;s always unsatisfactory for our taste, and it takes a long time and a lot of energy to find the perfect one. We thought we were the only ones who had this problem.

            Turns out we are not alone. We read a lot of FB group posts and observed that finding your preferred living space requires a lot of time, like months of walking, searching, and waiting for someone to post in the FB groups about that one perfect room. It&apos;s frustrating when the next morning it&apos;s already taken. Some of us want to know the location, if it is near, if it has air conditioning, and if it has a nice ambiance.

            So we asked ourselves, what if we make a website? After a year of struggling with essential core features, identifying the problem, and defining use cases, we found out users need security, convenience, and preference.
